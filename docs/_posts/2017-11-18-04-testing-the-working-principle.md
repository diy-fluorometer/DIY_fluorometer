Well, it's easy, isn't it?

We have a dye, which becomes fluorescent when it is bound to DNA.


This is our basic setup.

We use a LED which should emit in the range of 490 to 513 nm (you can find
its datasheet here: ...).

We used textmarker to simulate DNA dye. In this picture, you see how the 
textmarker solution starts to fluoresce, when the LED is shining on it. 
Awesome!

Also, Lisa brought us some cool (and cheap) filters. 

This filter (

)
is absorbing most of the light of the LED away (mind that the LED is turned on
here as well, and looked blueish in the previous pictures)!

But, when you have your sample in the light pathway

you see (i.e. your eye measures) the light emitted from your sample. 
That's the fluorescence we're chasing!
