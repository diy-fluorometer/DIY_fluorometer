In principle, we want to build a light-proof case. 
The "L" form would be nice to generate a 90Â° angle.

We designed the case on <a href="http://www.makercase.com">www.makercase.com</a>.

You can find the preliminary but continuously updated files on 
<a href="https://github.com/rgiessmann/DIY_fluorometer/design_case_box">
github.com/rgiessmann/DIY_fluorometer/design_case_box
</a>.

The general idea is to make the case as modular as possible.

General dimensions of the case are going to be 150x150x50mm.

Later, we will prepare inserts into the case, to block away scatter light and 
to position the LEDs, filters, and detectors at variable distances.
