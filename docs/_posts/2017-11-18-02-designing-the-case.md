In principle, we want to build a light-proof case. 
The "L" form would be nice to generate a 90Â° angle.

We designed the case on www.makercase.com
You can find the preliminary files on github.com/rgiessmann/DIY_fluorometer/...

The general idea is to make the case as modular as possible.

For this, we prepare inserts into the case, dimensions 3x3x44mm for outer insert, 3x3x38 for bottom-down inserts.

General dimensions are going to be 50x50x150mm.
